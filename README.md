# Country List

My task is integrating with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

Your users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
